1 System Requirements

GRiP (Gene Regulation in Prokaryotes) is an asynchronous, event driven, hybrid model of the facilitated diffusion mechanism in prokaryotic systems. This software is implemented in Sun Java 1.6, which makes it widely available. The system requirements are
1. Java Runtime Environment 1.6 
2. At least 3GB free RAM

The application, uses in most cases less than 2GB of RAM, but we preallocate more to cover any unexpected case. The user has the possibility to change this, when calling the .jar files (see below).
